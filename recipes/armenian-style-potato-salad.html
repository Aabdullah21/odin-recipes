    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> this Armenian-style potato salad is completely different. And completely delicious. Serve drizzled with more
        olive oil and garnished with more fresh mint.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, quartered, and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint, divided</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Transfer sliced potatoes into a large pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by a couple of
            inches. Stir in 1 rounded tablespoon kosher salt and 2 ½ teaspoons dried mint. Bring to a boil over high
            heat. Reduce heat to medium and let cook until tender, about 15 minutes, checking every 5 to 6 minutes for
            doneness. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>While potatoes cool, heat ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add red onion, red bell
            pepper, garlic, and a pinch of salt; cook and stir for just 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in
            remaining dried mint.</li>
        <li>Drizzle freshly squeezed lemon juice into potatoes and toss gently with a spatula. Add green onions, red
            onion mixture, remaining olive oil, fresh mint, fresh parsley, salt to taste, black pepper, chili flakes,
            and cayenne. Mix with a spatula until combined.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and flavors have melded, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Unwrap; stir, taste, and adjust seasonings as needed to personal tastes. The salad almost always needs more
            salt stirred in once it's tasted after being chilled. Serve.</li>

    </ul>
