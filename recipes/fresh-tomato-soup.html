    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>New Jersey is a well-known producer of tomatoes. Having our own garden leaves us with an abundance at the end of
        the season. Not wanting the tomatoes to go to waste, Hubby and I came up with our favorite version of tomato
        soup.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 cups peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped carrots</li>
        <li>¾ cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 (13.75 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the tomatoes, carrots, and onion to a boil over medium-high heat in a stockpot, then reduce heat to
            medium-low. Simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Whisk in the flour, stirring until thick. Slowly
            whisk in the milk until smooth. Cook and stir, whisking constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes, then
            stir milk mixture in to the stockpot. Season with basil, celery salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.
            Continue to simmer the soup on low to reduce and thicken, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
